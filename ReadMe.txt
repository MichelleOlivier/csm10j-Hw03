*General Overview
I had AssetForm.java do all of the work instead of splitting it up into the other forms. I felt it was more efficent for me to do that.


I had a lot of problems with setting up GUI. I tried using Paint but it wasn't working out (and I was spending a lot of my alloted
time trying to figure that out. So instead, I just focused on getting the program functional.


I found it easier to reference assets as instances, in order to make decisions in the program.


I passed the reference of the main form to the asset form. The vector is public so I was able to put mainform.[vector]



*Bugs and Problems
I didn't have enought time to make sure the data doesn't duplicate, and I also didn't finish the combo box for car and house. 
So the Assets that are testable are Stock and Bank Account. 


The layout was the most difficult thing for me. I found myself tinkering with it and trying to watch tutorials, 
but I ran into so many issues I decided to do what I could, and make it function as much as I could get it to. 


When you press d to delete it, it shifts the selection.
Double click brings up the update form, but I didn't have enought time to complete the update logic. 


I wish I could have figured more out, faster than I did. A lot of time was wasted, trying to learn how to do something, 
and then have multiple bugs pop up throughout the code.  


I also wish I had studied how to do layouts more than I did. I ended up going with what I knew I could do, because using paint wasn't 
working out for me.  I think if I had a couple more days I could get it to match your example, but I would need to learn more 
about the visual GUI layout options.
